    "# math — Mathematical functions¶\n",
    "# This module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "# These functions cannot be used with complex numbers; use the functions of the same name from the cmath module if you require support for complex numbers. The distinction between functions which support complex numbers and those which don’t is made since most users do not want to learn quite as much mathematics as required to understand complex numbers. Receiving an exception instead of a complex result allows earlier detection of the unexpected complex number used as a parameter, so that the programmer can determine how and why it was generated in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The following functions are provided by this module. Except when explicitly noted otherwise, all return values are floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Number-theoretic and representation functions\n",
    "# math.ceil(x)\n",
    "# Return the ceiling of x, the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. If x is not a float, delegates to x.__ceil__, which should return an Integral value.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Also called the binomial coefficient because it is equivalent to the coefficient of k-th term in polynomial expansion of (1 + x)ⁿ.\n",

    "# Raises TypeError if either of the arguments are not integers. Raises ValueError if either of the arguments are negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "# New in version 3.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "# math.copysign(x, y)\n",
    "# Return a float with the magnitude (absolute value) of x but the sign of y. On platforms that support signed zeros, copysign(1.0, -0.0) returns -1.0.\n",

    "# math.fmod(x, y)\n",
    "# Return fmod(x, y), as defined by the platform C library. Note that the Python expression x % y may not return the same result. The intent of the C standard is that fmod(x, y) be exactly (mathematically; to infinite precision) equal to x - n*y for some integer n such that the result has the same sign as x and magnitude less than abs(y). Python’s x % y returns a result with the sign of y instead, and may not be exactly computable for float arguments. For example, fmod(-1e-100, 1e100) is -1e-100, but the result of Python’s -1e-100 % 1e100 is 1e100-1e-100, which cannot be represented exactly as a float, and rounds to the surprising 1e100. For this reason, function fmod() is generally preferred when working with floats, while Python’s x % y is preferred when working with integers.\n",

Behavior in exceptional cases follows Annex F of the C99 standard where appropriate. The current implementation will raise ValueError for invalid operations like sqrt(-1.0) or log(0.0) (where C99 Annex F recommends signaling invalid operation or divide-by-zero), and OverflowError for results that overflow (for example, exp(1000.0)). A NaN will not be returned from any of the functions above unless one or more of the input arguments was a NaN; in that case, most functions will return a NaN, but (again following C99 Annex F) there are some exceptions to this rule, for example pow(float('nan'), 0.0) or hypot(float('nan'), float('inf')).\n",
